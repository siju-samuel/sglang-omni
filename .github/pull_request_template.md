## CI

CI runs on self-hosted GPU runners and requires a maintainer to add the
`run-ci` label. Once labeled, every subsequent push re-triggers CI as
long as the label remains. Use `/tag-and-rerun-ci higgs` or
`/tag-and-rerun-ci moss` or `/tag-and-rerun-ci qwen3-tts` to select a TTS CI
model, and
`/tag-and-rerun-ci fun-asr`, `/tag-and-rerun-ci qwen3-asr` or
`/tag-and-rerun-ci whisper-asr` to select an ASR CI model. One selector from
each family can be combined, for example `/tag-and-rerun-ci moss fun-asr`.
Draft PRs are skipped even if labeled.

To run the Intel XPU lane on its own, without occupying the CUDA runners, use
`/tag-and-rerun-xpu-ci`. It adds the `run-xpu-ci` label and restarts only the
XPU CI workflow; `run-ci` is left as-is, so it neither starts nor stops the
CUDA lanes. Note that `xpu` is not a selector of `/tag-and-rerun-ci`: that
command always opts into every lane, so it is refused there.
