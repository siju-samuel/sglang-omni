"""Bucketed CUDA graphs for the Fun-ASR audio encoder + adaptor.

The encoder forward is launch-bound: hundreds of small kernels whose CPU-side
dispatch (Python launcher glue + driver calls) dwarfs the GPU time. Replaying
a captured graph reduces the whole forward to a single launch.

Unlike the MOSS-TD Whisper runner (fixed input length, only the chunk count
varies), Fun-ASR varies in two dims: batch size (1..pre_lm_max_batch_size)
and LFR frame count (up to ~500 for the 30 s clip limit). We bucket both and
pad up on replay:

* batch rows are padded with ``ilens=1`` silence rows (a fully-masked row
  would produce NaN through SDPA; one valid zero frame keeps the row finite
  and its output is discarded),
* time is padded with masked frames — the same masking the eager batched
  path already applies to every non-longest item in a batch.

The SANM mask is derived from a static lengths tensor *inside* the capture,
so a replay only needs ``copy_`` of the input features and lengths.

Capture reaches the device through ``torch.get_device_module``, so this runs on
any accelerator whose device module exposes graphs (CUDA, XPU); the two spell
the graph type differently and XPU's capture context takes no error mode, which
is all ``_new_graph`` and ``_capture_context`` are for.
